      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Pavan, a software and technology enthusiast with over 13 years of experience building applications for Governments, SMEs and multinationals, having advised across eGovernance, eCommerce, Finance, Insurance, Telecom and Cloud security domains.
I&amp;rsquo;ve built, shipped and maintained production quality products for various clients, having worked on hard problems with some exceptionally bright people and have that experience to draw upon.
Being a fast learner, I can pick-up new tools rather quickly.</description>
